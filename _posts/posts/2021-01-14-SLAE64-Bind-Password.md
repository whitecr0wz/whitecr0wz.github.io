#### Introduction

These series of posts starting with the prefix "SLAE64 - Assignment" will be created in order to fulfill the requirements of the SLAE64 certification. Today we are going to have a 
close look at Linux Bind Shells with password protection. 

A Bind shell is a form of malware which grants remote access to a system through a shell. However, it differentiates from its peer the Reverse Shell, binding to a local port of 
the compromised system, instead of arranging a specific connection on a trivial address. Furthermore, after the connection is established, a shell is executed, granting 
interaction to the attacker

The first assignment from the seven is divided in two sections:

+ A: Requires the creation of a Bind Shell with password protection through the Assembly language, and converting such into shellcode. 
+ B: The discussed Bind Shell provided during the course should be modified, in order that it no longer possesses any form of NULL bytes (00). 

As exercise A is already quite a complex and long exercise, the first assignment will be segmented in two different posts, thing which may repeat within the second assignment.
